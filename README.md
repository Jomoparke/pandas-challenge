From the data provided we were able breakdown and present a summary based on the school districts and the schools themselves. for example we showed the passing rate of students who took math and reading from grades 9 - 11, we also showed what those rates were based on district, school, grade and even budget. Through that it was possible to higlight the highest and lowest performing schools

As a result, it is clear to see that the average scores for reading are higher than math amongst all grades. Also the passing percentage for reading is almost 10% even though the average passing grade is relatively close.
